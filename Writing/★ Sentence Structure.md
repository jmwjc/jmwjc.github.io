# Sentence Patterns
The patterns are most easily classified according to the type of verb used:
1. Verb of being patterns (1, 2, 3) use a form of the verb to be as the main verb in the sentence.
2. Linking verb patterns (4, 5) use one of the linking verbs as the main verb in the sentence.  The linking verb is followed by a noun or adjective functioning as a subjective complement.
3. Action verb patterns (6, 7, 8, 9, 10) use one of the many action verbs as the main verb in the sentence.  The action verb may be either transitive (take a direct object) or intransitive (not take a direct object).

**Terms** used to identify various parts of each sentence pattern include the following:
- NP = noun phrase
- V-be = verb of being
- LV = linking verb
- V-int = intransitive verb
- V-tr = transitive verb
- ADV/TP = adverbial of time or place
- ADJ = adjective

The five **basic** sentence patterns are list as follows:
> 1. NP1 + V-be + ADV/TP
> 2. NP1 + V-be/LV + ADJ
> 3. NP1 + V-be/LV + NP1
> 4. NP1 + V-int
> 5. NP1 + V-tr + NP2

Moreover, there are nine transformations of basic sentence patterns:
## Transform to passive voice
This transform requires the following basic sentence patterns: 
> 5. NP1 + V-tr + NP2
To create the transformation,
1. make the direct object into the subject
2. add the "be" auxiliary and the *-en* ending to the main verb
3. place the original doer of the action into a prepositional phrase beginning with *by*

## Transform to the expletive *there is/are*
This transform requires the following basic sentence patterns: 
> 1. NP1 + V-be + ADV/TP
To create the transformation,
1. place *there* at the beginning of the sentence
2. reverse positions of the subject and verb

## Transform to cleft
This transformation allows the writer to emphasize the sentence subject or object.
This transformation may be used with any of the sentence patterns.
There are two ways to create this transformation.
<u>Method 1</u>
1. Begin the sentence with ***It*** and the appropriate number and tense of the verb of being
2. focus on either the subject or direct object
3. create a second half for the sentence that begins with ***who, whom, or that***.

<u>Method 2</u>
1. Begin the sentence with ***What***
2. follow with the subject and verb
3. insert the appropriate tense of the verb of being and follow with the direct object

## Transform to negative
## Transform to interrogative with *yes/no* answer
## Transform to interrogative
## Transform to emphasis/emphatic
## Transform to exclamatory
