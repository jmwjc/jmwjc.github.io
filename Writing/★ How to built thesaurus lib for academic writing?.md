For academic writing, a systemic category of thesaurus is still miss. I wander how to link the verbs based upon the sections of paper, lots of nouns, verbs and phrases can be used in not only one place. The initial category scheme is designated as following rules:
- classify the verbs and phrases by purposing. 
- classify the sentence patterns in each section, and link the verb groups distinguished by purposing.
- the prepositions and adverbs can be classified by its [[★ Thesaurus|function]].
