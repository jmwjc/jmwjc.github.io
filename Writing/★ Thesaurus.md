# Adjectives
Traditionally, adjectives are defined as words that describe nouns or pronouns.  When they describe nouns or pronouns, adjectives typically answer the following questions:
> what kind? which one? how many?

```

# Conjunctions
## Coordinating conjunctions
```
for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so
```
- Coordinating conjunctions join *words to words*, *phrases to phrases*, *clauses to clauses*.
- Coordinating conjunctions always go in between items joined, not at the beginning or end.
- When a coordinating conjunction joins two words, phrases, or subordinate clauses, no comma should be placed before the conjunction.
- A coordinating conjunction joining three or more words, phrases, or subordinate clauses creates a series and requires commas between the elements.
- A coordinating conjunction joining two independent clauses creates a compound sentence and requires a comma before the coordinating conjunction.

## Correlative conjunctions
```
either...or
both...and
neither...nor
not only...but also
```
- Correlative conjunctions requires equal structures after each one.

## Conjunctive adverbs 
- Conjunctive adverbs join independent clauses together.
- A comma after the conjunctive adverb.

## Subordinating conjunctions
- Subordinating conjunctions also join two clauses together, but in doing so, they make one clause dependent (or "subordinate") upon the other.
- A subordinating conjunction may appear at a sentence beginning or between two clauses in a sentence.
- When the dependent clause is placed first in a sentence, use a comma between the two clauses.
- When the independent clause is placed first and the dependent clause second, do not separate the two clauses with a comma.
