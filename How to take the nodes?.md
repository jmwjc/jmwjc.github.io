# Some bothering me problems (2021-08-29)
In my working life, the low efficiency is always accompanied with me. Especially after finishing my PhD degree, we have to teach students, look after my son, and deal with the family staff, a lot of things divide my working time into small pieces. As a result, my research process is very slow, so I want to do some change to improve my working efficiency.

- **How to record my fleeting idea?** It is about how to record it conveniently and how to do my derivation manuscript?
- **How to schedule my daily life?** I want to immediately know what am I going to do as I begin to work, and stop it whenever another staff interrupt me.
All of the notes will be created with a convenient searching mode, I am going to design a system of tagging every notes for a quickly access. The obsidian provides 3 different ways regarded as the key words for searching, i.e. tags, titles and links.  @Bryan Jenks provides a detail [Tag Taxonomy](https://publish.obsidian.md/bryan-jenks/Tag+Taxonomy) for systematically tagging.
As referring to the @Bryan Jenks's system, The tags is represented as a *status* of notes.
