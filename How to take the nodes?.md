# Some bothering me problems (2021-08-29)
In my working life, the low efficiency is always accompanied with me. Especially after finishing my PhD degree, we have to teach students, look after my son, and deal with the family staff, a lot of things divide my working time into small pieces. As a result, my research process is very slow, so I want to do some change to improve my working efficiency.
Firstly, I want to rise a habit of taking notes, to help me thinking or organizing my daily life. So I can immediately focus on my working in discrete time pieces. Thus, I list the following desired request about my workflow of my note.
- **How to organize my knowledge management?** For instance, I want to organize some knowledge about mathematics or mechanics. This problem will be solved by how to define the tags and templates.
- **How to record my fleeting idea?** It is about how to record it conveniently and how to do my derivation manuscript?
- **How to schedule my daily life?** I want to immediately know what am I going to do as I begin to work, and stop it whenever another staff interrupt me.
