**1.2.1** As a review, construct complete proofs of the following classical theorems of functional analysis and linear operator theory.
(a) *The **Riesz** Representation Theorem*. Let $H$ be a real Hilbert space with inner product $(\cdot,\cdot)_{H}$ and let $H'$ denote the space of all continuous linear functionals on $H$ (i.e., $H'$ is the dual of $H$). Then, for every $f \in H'$ there exists a unique element $u \in H$ such that


$$
f(v) = (u,v)_{H} \quad \forall v \in H
$$

Moreover,

$$
\lVert f \rVert _{H'} = \lVert u \rVert _{H}
$$

where $\lVert \cdot\rVert _{H'}$ and $\lVert \cdot\rVert _{H}$ are the norms on $H'$ and $H$, respectively.
