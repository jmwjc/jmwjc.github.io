# Course Description

Finite element method (FEM) is the most popular numerical tool for solving the partial differential equations arising in engineering and researching modeling. For example, heat transfer, structural analysis, fluid flow, electromagnetic potential and so on. The course will learn the mathematic basis and practical usage of FEM, including some trivial numerical implement of 1D and 2D FEM programs.

# **Assignment Submission**

Homework problems will be assigned on weekly basis. These problems, along with material covered in lecture, will form the basis for exam problems. All of the homework must be submitted before the start of course on Wednesday. The electronic copies will be accepted, and you can sent them to my e-mail(jcwu@hqu.edu.cn). 

# Final Examination

The finial exam will be comprehensive with an emphasis on the material covered in Ch3 and Ch7. No students will permitted to make up an exam unless advanced notice of absence is given to the instructor in person.
